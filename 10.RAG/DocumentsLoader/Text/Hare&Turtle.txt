The Tortoise and the Hare
 Aesop's Fables
 A hare was making fun of a tortoise one day for being so slow.
 “Do you ever get anywhere?” he asked with a laugh and a smile.
 “Yes,” replied the tortoise, “and I get there sooner than you think.”
 The hare didn’t believe her.  After all, the tortoise had a large shell
 on her back.  Each shell is big and heavy, but the tortoise’s legs were
 short.
 “I’m twice as fast as you,” said the hare.
 “You think so, do you?” said the tortoise.  She continued, “Let’s
 have a race to find out.”
 “Haha,” the hare laughed.  “You really want to have a race against me?  If you really want
 to, then let’s do it.  This is going to be a joke.”
 “Say what you want, but at the end of the day, I’m coming in first,” the tortoise replied.
 The hare and tortoise agreed to run one kilometer.  They asked a fox to be the judge.
 The fox announced, “Three … two … one … start!”
 The hare started off quickly.  In just one minute, the hare was down the road and out of
 sight.
 After running for a while, the hare got bored.  He felt bad, because he challenged the tortoise
 to a race when everyone knows tortoises are one of the slowest animals in the world.  To keep
 things interesting, he sat down under a tree to take a nap and wait for the tortoise to catch up.
 The tortoise was slow, as tortoises always have been.  Little by little, the tortoise ran down
 the road.  She ran at a slow but steady pace, and she kept her speed even.
 After ten minutes, the tortoise passed the tree where the hare sat sleeping.  The tortoise was
 focused on the race, though, and she didn’t even see him there.  Five minutes later, the tortoise
 crossed the finish line.
 “Congratulations!” said the fox.  “You came in first place.”
 Right then, the hare came running up the road.  He woke up from his nap, but it was too late.
 The fastest runner doesn’t always win the race.
